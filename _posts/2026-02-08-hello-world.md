## Writing a New Post

Create a file in `_posts/` with the naming format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.md
```

Add front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-03-15
tags: [vulnerability-research, synology, cve]

```

Then write your content in Markdown below the front matter.
